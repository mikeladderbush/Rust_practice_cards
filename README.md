# Rust_practice_cards

  I was interested in learning as much as I could about Rust at a leisurely
pace in my spare time. This game is supposed to be stupidly over-engineered for now, I
want to be able to play around with anything that comes to mind. This will probably 
remain private as well but if anyone does end up reading this please keep in mind
I am very much a beginner and the goal here is education over anything else.
